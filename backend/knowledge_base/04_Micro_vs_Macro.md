# League of Legends: Micro vs Macro Gameplay

## 1. Understanding Micro Gameplay

### What is Micro?
Micro refers to individual mechanical skills and champion control. It's everything related to how well you play your personal champion at any given moment.

### Micro Components

- Execute complex combos under pressure

**Last-Hitting (CS)**
- Timing minion kills precisely
- Farming efficiently in all circumstances
- Prioritizing high-value targets (cannons)
- Adaptation to tower mechanics

**Positioning**
- Physical placement relative to enemies
- Spacing from threats
- Movement speed and kiting
- Staying in range to deal damage without taking unnecessary hits

**Mechanics**
- Animation cancels (reducing ability lag)
- Attack-move (attacking while moving)
- Skillshot accuracy
- Reaction time to threats

**Trading & Dueling**
- Short trades: Damage exchange with opponent
- All-ins: Committing to kill enemy
- Kiting: Backstepping while attacking
- Wave management during duels

**Ability Management**

- Resource management (energy, fury, etc.)
- Optimal ability sequencing

### Micro Examples

**Bad Micro**

## 8. Common Mistakes & Corrections

### Micro Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Overextending While CSing**
- **Problem**: Get ganked farming deep
- **Fix**: Track jungler, play safer when unknown
- **Prevention**: Minimap awareness habit

**Mistake 2: Tunneling on One Opponent**
- **Problem**: Focus so much on duel you miss map threats
- **Fix**: Glance minimap between attacks
- **Prevention**: Conscious awareness training

**Mistake 3: Poor Ability Usage**
- **Problem**: Waste cooldowns on non-threats
- **Fix**: Be intentional with ability usage
- **Prevention**: Practice ability economy

### Macro Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Fighting When Behind**
- **Problem**: Team already down, can't win fights
- **Fix**: Analyze fight chances before committing
- **Prevention**: Calculate odds before engaging

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Objective Timings**
- **Problem**: Farming when dragon spawn in 10 seconds
- **Fix**: Know objective spawn times
- **Prevention**: Mental timer for objectives

**Mistake 3: Abandoning Winning Condition**
- **Problem**: Team comp wins through teamfighting but you split push
- **Fix**: Play your team composition's win condition
- **Prevention**: Discuss win condition at start

## 9. Micro-Macro Integration

### Executing Macro Plays with Micro Skill

**Gank Setup**
- Macro: Identify gank opportunity (enemy overextended)
- Micro: Execute gank perfectly (land skillshots, kite properly)
- Integration: Good macro + good micro = kill

**Objective Teamfight**
- Macro: Call dragon teamfight at right time
- Micro: Execute positioning and abilities correctly
- Integration: Macro positioning + micro execution = objective

**Wave Crash Execution**
- Macro: Plan wave crash timing
- Micro: Last-hit perfectly to crash wave
- Integration: Macro plan + micro execution = economy advantage

### Decision-Making Under Pressure

**High Micro/Low Macro**
- Mechanics solid, decisions questionable
- Example: Winning lane but losing game
- Improvement: Focus macro decision-making

**Low Micro/High Macro**
- Decisions excellent, mechanics lag
- Example: Right plays, failing execution
- Improvement: Mechanical practice

**High Micro/High Macro**
- Both excellent, rare and powerful
- Complete players dominate
- Maintenance: Keep both sharp

---

## Next Steps

1. Identify your weaker area (micro or macro)
2. Focus practice on that area for 2 weeks
3. Maintain stronger area while improving weaker
4. Gradually balance both aspects

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I balance micro and macro?**
A: Practice both consistently. If one is weak, focus there while maintaining the other.

**Q: Can I climb purely on mechanics?**
A: Yes, but it's harder. You'll win lanes but macro mistakes cost games.

**Q: Can I climb purely on macro?**
A: Yes, but you'll lose mechanical matchups. Harder at high elo.

**Q: Which should I learn first?**
A: Fundamentals first (Last-hitting, positioning), then macro, then advanced micro.

**Q: Do pro players focus on micro or macro?**
A: Both equally. They're excellent at both aspects simultaneously.
