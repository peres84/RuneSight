## Key Concepts Overview

### What is League of Legends?
League of Legends is a 5v5 MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where two teams battle to destroy the enemy's base (Nexus). Players control individual champions with unique abilities and progressively become stronger through leveling and item purchases funded by gold.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Laning Phase** (0-15 min): Secure minion kills (CS) for gold, level up, maintain map control
2. **Mid Game** (15-25 min): Objective control, team fights, rotations, and scaling
3. **Late Game** (25+ min): Team fights around major objectives, positioning, closing the game

### Three Core Pillars of Success
1. **Micro** - Individual mechanical skill and champion mastery
2. **Macro** - Strategic decision-making and map awareness
3. **Economy** - Gold generation and resource management

## Important Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CS (Creep Score)** | Number of minions killed; primary gold source |
| **Gank** | Coordinated attack by multiple players on a single target |
| **Roam** | Movement to another lane to impact gameplay |
| **Wave Management** | Controlling minion wave position for advantage |
| **Vision Control** | Using wards to see/deny enemy information |
| **Objective** | Towers, Dragons, Baron, Inhibitors - strategic targets |
| **Engage** | Initiating a team fight |
| **Disengage** | Retreating from or avoiding confrontation |
| **Scaling** | Champion power growth as items and levels increase |
| **Win Condition** | Path to victory based on team composition |

## Map Structure

### Summoner's Rift Basics
- **3 Lanes**: Top, Mid, Bot (each with 3 turrets + 1 inhibitor)
- **Jungle**: Area between lanes containing neutral monsters
- **River**: Central corridor connecting lanes
- **Baron/Dragon Pits**: Major objective locations in river

### Each Lane Contains
- 3 defense turrets per team
- 1 inhibitor (spawns super minions when destroyed)
- 1 nexus (core objective, located behind structures)
