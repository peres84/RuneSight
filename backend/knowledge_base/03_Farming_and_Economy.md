# League of Legends: Farming & Economy Management

## 1. Introduction to Farming

### What is Farming?
Farming (also called CS or creep score) is the act of last-hitting minions to secure gold income. It's the primary income source for champions and directly translates to item power.

### Why Farming is Critical
- **Consistency**: Minions respawn predictably every 30 seconds
- **Reliability**: You control your farm outcome (unlike kills)
- **Snowballing**: Better farm → Better items → Stronger → Easier kills
- **Recovery**: Falling behind in kills but ahead in farm enables comeback

### CS to Gold Conversion
- 1 minion ≈ 20 gold
- 10 CS = 200 gold = Major item component
- 100 CS at 15 min = ~2000 gold advantage = Full item lead

## 2. Last-Hitting Mechanics

### What is Last-Hitting?
Dealing the final damage to kill a minion, granting you full gold value. Not the first hit—only the killing blow grants gold.

### Why Only Last-Hits Matter
- Attacking minions repeatedly grants no gold
- Killing minion = 20-50 gold (depends on type)
- Missing minion = 0 gold (wasted damage/mana)
- Consistency beats perfection

### Last-Hitting Requirements

**Timing Knowledge**
- Know your champion's auto-attack speed (animation windups)
- Predict minion death timing
- Account for damage from minions and turrets
- Time your final hit perfectly

**Damage Calculation**
- Monitor minion health bars
- Estimate damage from your auto-attacks
- Account for turret/minion damage already dealt
- Strike when minion health ≈ your auto-attack damage

**Champion-Specific Factors**
- High attack damage: Easier last-hitting (higher damage per auto)
- High attack speed: More auto-attack opportunities
- High animation: Slower/clunkier attack (harder timing)
- Ability scaling: Some champions use abilities for farming (refund mechanics)

### Last-Hitting Under Turret

**Melee Minion Under Turret**
- Pattern: 2 turret hits → 1 auto-attack → kill
- Reason: Turret deals +50 damage per hit to minions
- Timing: Auto after 2nd turret shot lands

**Ranged Minion Under Turret**
- Pattern: 1 auto → 1 turret hit → 1 auto → kill
- OR: 1 turret hit → 2 autos → kill (depends on AD)
- More timing-sensitive than melee

**Cannon Minion Under Turret**
- Pattern: 2 turret hits → ability if needed → finish with auto
- Cannon has more HP: May need ability to secure
- High value: Always priority to secure

**Early Game Priority**
- With no items: Turret mechanics are strict (2-1 pattern mandatory)
- With items: Higher AD makes timing easier
- Supporting ADC: Hit one back minion to set up for ADC's secure

### Last-Hitting Practice Progression

**Stage 1: Perfect Mechanics (No Items, No Enemies)**
- Start Practice Tool at 0:00
- Set champion level to 1
- Don't buy any items

- Maintain farm despite enemy pressure
- Goal: 40 CS per 5 minutes while being harassed

**Stage 3: Realistic Laning**
- Full items and runes enabled
- Enemy champion actively trying to prevent farm
- Realistic game conditions
- Goal: 8-10 CS/min consistently

**Stage 4: Custom Game**
- Play vs. teammate/friend
- Learn adaptation to opposing playstyle

## 4. Wave Management (Critical Macro Skill)

### Wave Management Overview
Controlling minion wave position to create strategic advantages. This combines CSing with map strategy.

### Core Wave Concepts

**Wave Composition**
- Waves contain mix of minion types
- Advantages/disadvantages determine kill rates
- Managing numbers creates farm opportunities

**Push vs. Freeze vs. Slow Push**

### Pushing Strategy

**Definition**: Killing minions faster than enemy, causing wave to move toward enemy tower

**When to Push**
- Going for roams (deny enemy minions at tower)
- Setting up for ganks (compress wave at enemy tower)
- Before recalling (deny enemy free farm)
- Against opponents in a bad matchup (safety)

**How to Push**
- Last-hit all minions + use abilities to damage
- Use AoE abilities on full waves
- Push wave into enemy tower rapidly

**Consequences**
- Positive: Denial of CS, jungle gank setup, tower pressure
- Negative: Extended positioning (vulnerable to ganks), tower damage

### Freezing Strategy

**Definition**: Keeping minion wave near your tower without pushing

**How to Freeze**
- Only last-hit minions you absolutely need
- Let enemy minions attack your minions
- Maintain slight minion advantage toward enemy (they have more minions)
- Minions kill enemy minions naturally, wave stays in place

**Freezing Requirements**
- Precise minion advantage (very specific number/position)
- Discipline to not overkill minions
- Enemy jungler tracking (safety consideration)

**When to Freeze**
- Winning lane (force opponent to extend for CS)
- Against aggressive champions (safety)
- When ahead in position (create gank opportunity for jungler)
- Your jungler has priority

**Consequences**
- Positive: Safe farming, baiting enemy overextension, gank setup
- Negative: Lower CS rate, less map pressure, requires skill to execute

### Slow Push Strategy

**Definition**: Gradually building wave advantage to crash large wave into enemy tower

**How Slow Push Works**
1. Only last-hit minions (don't use abilities)
2. Wave accumulates over 2-3 waves
3. Eventually wave reaches critical mass
4. Crashes large wave into enemy tower (15-20 minions)

**Timing**
- Takes ~1.5-2 minutes to build large wave
- Must plan ahead
- Coordinate with team movements

**When to Slow Push**
- Before grouped teamfights (gain economic advantage)
- Mid-game wave management
- Creating wave pressure in different lane
- Setting up siege scenarios

**Consequences**
- Positive: Large economic advantage from crashed wave, pressure on tower
- Negative: Takes time to execute, predictable pattern, requires enemy to not crash it first

## 5. Farming Efficiency Techniques

### Champion-Specific Abilities
Some champions have abilities specifically designed for farming:

**Mages with Farming Abilities**
- Annie (Q - Disintegrate): Mana refund on minion kill
- Malzahar (E - Malefic Visions): Bounces to new minions, refunds mana
- Ezreal (Q - Mystic Shot): Low cooldown, resets with hits
- Effect: Easier CSing, can farm without auto-attacks

**Melee with Reset Abilities**
- Riven (passive - Runic Blade): Auto-attack resets
- Fiora (W - Riposte): Resets auto-attack timer
- Effect: Rapid minion clears, easier consecutive last-hits

**Attack Reset Items**
- Hextech Protobelt: Activates then auto-reset
- Tiamat line: AoE damage for wave clear
- Effect: Enhanced farming in waves

### Ability Usage for Farming

**When to Use Abilities**
- Large waves (2+ minions low HP)
- Clearing wave quickly (roam/recall needed)
- Breaking enemy freeze (must use to break pattern)
- Securing cannon minion (high-value target)

**When NOT to Use Abilities**
- Single minions (waste of mana)
- Early game (mana pool small)
- When expecting fight soon (need mana for combat)
- Against aggressive laners (invites engagement)

### Build Optimization for Farming

**Early Game Items for Better CSing**
- Attack Damage items (easier auto-attack scaling)
- Attack Speed items (more auto-attacks per second)
- Ability Power items (if champion uses abilities for farming)

**Decision Making**
- Build damage if farming well (accelerate advantage)
- Build defensively if struggling with harass (enables safer farming)
- Balance aggressive items with defensive needs

---

## 6. Farming with Enemy Pressure

### Trading While Farming
Simultaneous mechanics: Farming minions while harassing opponent

**Auto-Attack Minion + Enemy**
- Position so auto-attack line includes minion and enemy
- Auto-attack minion while applying enemy harassment
- Divide attention: Farm + Pressure simultaneously

**Spacing for Safety**
- Stay at max range from enemy
- Position behind minion wave (damage block)
- Use minions as barrier between you and threat
- Watch enemy positioning while farming

### Adapting to Jungle Threats

**Tracking Enemy Jungler**
- Identify where enemy jungler starts (usually same side as nearby drake)
- Track movements based on roams and kills visible
- Early game: Expect jungle around 3-5 minute mark
- Adjust farming aggression based on threat level

**Playing Forward vs. Backward**
- Safe Zone: Farm near tower when jungler nearby
- Aggressive Zone: Extend forward when jungler away or tracked elsewhere
- Minimap awareness: Check every 3-5 seconds

**Freezing for Safety**
- If jungler actively hunting you, freeze lane
- Forces aggressive positioning from enemy
- Baits jungle gank attempts on overextended opponents

## 7. Gold Generation Strategies

### Pure Farming Income
- Focus farming, minimal kills
- Consistent, predictable gold flow
- Requires discipline and positioning

**Income Calculation**
- 10 CS/min = ~200 gold/min from farming
- Add ~200 gold/min from kills/assists/objectives
- Target: 400+ gold/min in mid-game

### Kill/Assist Income
- Kills provide burst of gold
- Encourages risky plays
- Unreliable compared to farming

**Kill Gold Allocation**
- Kill reward: 50-250 gold (depends on bounty)
- Shared among killers and assists
- More value from kills than CS (but riskier)

### Objective Bounty Generation

**Tower Destruction**: 300-400 gold (team split)
- Outer towers: ~15 min average
- Inner towers: ~20-30 min average
- Nexus towers: ~35+ min average

**Dragon Objective**: 125-825 gold (team split)
- Early dragon (pre-15): 125-300 gold
- Stacked dragons: 500+ gold with soul potential
- Prioritize in competitive play

**Baron Objective**: 300 gold (team split)
- High-risk teamfight
- Enables siege/wave push with buff
- Usually takes 20 seconds to solo/duo, requires security

### Economy Efficiency
- Farming alone: Most efficient income per minute
- Farming + objectives: Balanced approach
- Kill-focused: Exciting but less consistent

---

## 8. Farm Denial & Zoning

### What is Zoning?
Using positioning and threat to prevent enemy from accessing minions (psychological + physical space control)

### Zoning Mechanics
- Stand between enemy and dying minions
- Maintain threat so they can't step up
- Force them to choose: Take harass or lose CS
- Effective when winning lane

**When Zoning Works**
- When you're stronger in duel
- Against low-mobility champions
- When having minion advantage
- With jungler nearby for backup

**When Zoning Fails**
- Against stronger matchups
- Without minion advantage (they farm under tower)
- Against long-range champions (can CS safely)
- With no backup vs. coordinated team

### Minion Advantage Calculation
- More of your minions = easier zoning
- Opponent can still farm under tower if minion advantage fails
- Mathematical advantage needed (20+ minion advantage = guaranteed zone)

---

## 9. Economy Management Across Roles

### ADC (Marksman) - Farm-Focused Role
- Expected: 9-10 CS/min
- Focus: Prioritize farming above all else
- Playstyle: Defensive positioning, consistent CS
- Win condition: Superior scaling through farm

### Top Lane - Split-Push Farmer
- Expected: 8-9 CS/min
- Focus: Wave management and side lane control
- Playstyle: Farm top lane waves, roam for objectives when needed
- Win condition: Scaling + split push pressure

### Mid Lane - Balanced Farmer
- Expected: 8-10 CS/min
- Focus: Farm but also roam for impact
- Playstyle: Balanced between farming and teamfighting
- Win condition: Scaling + early roam pressure

### Jungle - Lower CS Role
- Expected: 5-6 CS/min (from camps)
- Focus: Ganks and objective control > farming
- Playstyle: Efficient clear routes, frequent ganks
- Win condition: Early ganks, objective control

### Support - Minimal Farm Role
- Expected: 1-3 CS/min (shared kills/minions)
- Focus: Economy from items, not CS
- Playstyle: Prioritize teammate farming, take minimally
- Win condition: Enabling teammates through setup

## 10. Common Farming Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake: Using Too Many Abilities
**Problem**: Runs out of mana, can't fight or gank

**Fix**: Reserve abilities for:
- Large waves (efficiency trade)
- Breaking freezes (strategic need)
- Combat situations (actual threats)

### Mistake: Farming When Teamfight Needed
**Problem**: Team fights 4v5, loses crucial teamfight

**Fix**: Learn fight timings:
- Dragon/Baron spawning: Stop farming, group
- Missing enemies: Stop farming, position safely
- Turret siege: Stop farming, defend

### Mistake: Taking Resources from Carries
**Problem**: Jungler/support farms ADC minions, ADC falls behind

**Fix**: Role discipline:
- Junglers: Farm own camps, not lanes (unless lane is crashing to tower)
- Supports: Only farm when ADC not present or can't reach
- Midlaners: Don't take side lane farm during laning phase

### Mistake: Overextending for CS
**Problem**: Dies to jungle gank despite getting minion

**Fix**: Risk/reward analysis:
- Is minion worth death? (Almost never in early game)
- Is jungler tracked? (If not sure, play safe)
- Do I have escape tools? (If not, farm safer)

### Mistake: Not Adapting CS Playstyle
**Problem**: Uses same farming style against all matchups

**Fix**: Adapt to lane state:
- Losing lane: Farm under tower, freeze if possible
- Winning lane: Extend forward, zone opponents
- Even lane: Maintain wave balance, look for opportunities

## 11. Advanced Farming Concepts

### Minion Wave Bounce Back
When pushing wave dies at enemy tower, next wave spawns from your base:
- Creates predictable pattern
- Allows farming in safer area
- Requires patience to wait for bounce

### Gank Setup Through Wave Control
- Fast push: Force opponent to take minions under tower
- Jungler ganks overextended opponent
- Combines farming with gank coordination

### Late Game Efficient Farming
- Side lane farming between teamfights
- Maintaining wave pressure mid-game
- Trading objectives for wave/farm when behind
- Managing minion economy late game
