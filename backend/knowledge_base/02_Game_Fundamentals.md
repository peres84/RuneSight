# League of Legends: Game Fundamentals

## 1. Core Game Overview

### What is League of Legends?
League of Legends is a 5v5 team-based MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where players control individual champions to destroy the enemy team's base structure (the Nexus). The game combines individual skill with team coordination and strategic thinking.

### Primary Objective
**Destroy the enemy Nexus** - The heart of the enemy's base, protected by defense structures and champions.

### Game Duration
- Average game length: 25-40 minutes
- Minimum: ~15 minutes (surrender)
- Maximum: 50+ minutes (late game scaling)

## 2. Map Structure

### Summoner's Rift Layout

```
                          ENEMY BASE
                            Nexus
                        [Inhibitor Area]
                         [3 Turrets]
                              
     [River]        [Mid Lane]        [River]
Top Lane            [Jungle Areas]    Bot Lane
[Side Paths]        [Objectives]      [Side Paths]

                          NEXUS
                      [Inhibitor Area]
                       [3 Turrets]
                        YOUR BASE
```

### The Three Lanes

**Top Lane (Solo)**
- Longest lane, most isolated
- Typically features durable champions (tanks, bruisers)
- Games revolve around split-pushing and side lane pressure
- Home to champions like Garen, Darius, Ornn

**Mid Lane (Solo)**
- Central lane with equal rotation access to both sides
- High roaming and skirmish potential
- Often features versatile champions (mages, assassins)
- Champions like Ahri, Orianna, Akali are typical picks

**Bot Lane (Duo)**
- Shortest and most crowded lane
- ADC (damage dealer) + Support (utility) pairing
- Most objective-focused lane (early dragons, towers)
- ADC: Ashe, Caitlyn, Miss Fortune | Support: Leona, Janna, Nautilus

### The Jungle
- Area between lanes filled with neutral camps
- Home to the Jungler - roaming champion without set lane
- Objectives: Krugs, Raptors, Wolves, Buffs (Blue/Red), Scuttler
- Enables ganks (surprise attacks on lanes)

### River
- Central waterway dividing the map
- Major objective locations: Dragon pit, Baron pit
- Primary battleground for team fights
- Vision control here wins games

## 4. Core Game Mechanics

### Experience & Leveling

**Experience Sources (XP)**
- Killing minions (small amount)
- Killing champions (large amount)
- Being near dead minions/champions
- Passive XP from lane presence

**Leveling Progression**
- Level 1: Starting point
- Level 6: Ultimate (R ability) unlocks - major power spike
- Level 9-11: Mid-game power spikes
- Level 16-18: Late-game scaling
- Max Level: 18

**Power Spike Timing**
- Level 2-3: Early trading windows
- Level 6: Ultimate availability changes lane dynamics
- First item completion: Damage/utility spike
- Item breakpoints: Specific stat thresholds change effectiveness

### Gold & Economy

**Gold Sources**
1. **Minion Kills (CS)** - Primary source
   - Melee minion: ~18-20 gold (last-hit only)
   - Ranged minion: ~14-18 gold
   - Cannon minion: ~50-80 gold (high priority)
   - Super minion: ~100+ gold (late game)

2. **Champion Kills**
   - Kill bounty: 50-250+ gold depending on kill streak
   - Assist credit: 50% of kill bounty

3. **Objective Bounties**
   - Tower destruction: 300-400 gold team split
   - Dragon: 125-825 gold team split
   - Baron: 300 gold team split

4. **Passive Gold Income**
   - ~4-5 gold/10 seconds baseline
   - Modified by economy items

**CS (Creep Score) Targets**
- Beginner: 5-6 CS/min
- Intermediate: 7-8 CS/min
- Competitive: 9-10 CS/min
- Professional: 8-10 CS/min (varies by playstyle)

**Gold Per Minute (GPM) Impact**
- 30 CS at 10 min vs. 50 CS at 10 min = 400+ gold difference
- This translates directly to item advantage
- Item advantage = gameplay advantage

---

## 5. Items & Building

### Item System Overview
Players purchase items with gold to enhance their champion's stats and abilities. Items provide:
- Damage (Ability Power or Attack Damage)
- Survivability (Health, Armor, Magic Resistance)
- Utility (Movement speed, cooldown reduction, active effects)
- Synergies (Work together for greater effect)

### Build Strategy
- Don't save for complete items - buy components as you earn gold
- Build progressively from parts to full items
- Adapt builds against opponents (counters, threats)
- Core items for your champion → Situational items for matchup

### Item Categories
- **Damage Items**: Increase outgoing harm
- **Defensive Items**: Increase survivability
- **Utility Items**: Provide map control or team assistance
- **Mythic Items**: First big item providing unique power spike

---

## 6. Defense Structures & Objectives

### Turrets (Defensive Towers)
- **Count per lane**: 3 per team + 2 protecting nexus
- **Function**: Deal damage to enemies within range, last forever
- **HP scaling**: Gradually increases as structures fall
- **Strategic value**: Deny enemy map control, provide safety zone

**Turret Types by Position**
- Outer turrets: Easiest to destroy, control lane access
- Inner turrets: Harder, close to base
- Nexus turrets: Final defense before Nexus

### Inhibitors
- One per lane, located at end of second turret
- When destroyed: Spawns super minions in that lane indefinitely
- Can be revived (regenerate after 5 minutes)
- Destroying all 3 enables enemy Nexus attack

### Nexus
- Core structure representing team's main base
- 5000+ HP (scales with game time)
- Represents ultimate victory condition
- Destruction = instant game loss

### Minor Objectives
- **Scuttle Crab**: Provides vision + movement speed, neutral unit
- **Wards**: Temporary vision providing map control
- **Stealth Wards**: Trinket item providing vision denial

---

## 7. Dragon & Baron

### Dragon (Regular Objective)
- Spawns at 5:00, respawns every 5 minutes after death
- Teams fight for dragon control throughout game
- Grants elemental buffs with stacking effects

**Elemental Dragons** (Affect game significantly)
- Infernal: +8% AD/AP (damage increase)
- Ocean: +8% healing (sustain increase)
- Mountain: +8% armor/MR (durability increase)
- Cloud: +8% movement speed (kiting/roaming increase)
- Hextech (rare): Unique bonus effects

**Soul & Elder**
- 4th dragon of same type grants "Dragon Soul" - permanent buff
- 5+ dragons spawns Elder Dragon - kills enemies with low health

### Baron Nashor
- Spawns at 20:00, respawns 6 minutes after death
- Massive objective requiring teamwork to secure
- Grants "Baron Buff" to entire team for 3 minutes:
  - +40% empowered minions (push towers easier)
  - +40% damage to towers
  - Movement speed increase
  - Invisibility in brush

**Baron Impact**
- Enables base breaking and siege potential
- Game-changing objective in mid-late game
- "Can't play for Baron safely" = decision marker
- Losing Baron fight often determines game

---

## 8. Minions

### Minion Types

**Regular Minions** (3 per wave)
- Melee minions: Move forward, low range, tanky
- Ranged minions: Ranged attacks, lower HP, deal more damage
- Cannon minion: Appears every 3rd wave (every 2nd after 25 min)
  - Tanky, high damage, high gold reward (50-80 gold)
  - Priority target for securing

**Super Minions**
- Spawn when inhibitor destroyed in that lane
- Significantly more durable than regular minions
- High gold reward (100+ gold)
- Game-changing wave push power

**Minion Spawning**
- First wave: 1:05
- Subsequent waves: Every 30 seconds
- ~6 minions spawned per wave (3 melee, 2 ranged, sometimes cannon)

### Minion Behavior

Minions automatically:
- Target enemy minions first
- Target enemy turrets second
- Target enemy champions attacking their allies
- Deal cumulative damage (group of minions kills champions)

**Strategic Use**
- Position behind minions for damage block during trades
- Use minions to position relative to turret for farming
- Deny farm by controlling minion waves
- Create pressure through minion waves pushing toward objectives

---

## 9. Vision & Fog of War

### Fog of War
- Areas of map you cannot see (darkened on minimap)
- Enemy positions outside vision are unknown
- Creates need for map awareness and communication
- Creates opportunities for ganks and ambushes

### Vision Sources
- **Champion presence**: You see what your champion sees
- **Allied champions/minions**: Their vision extends to team
- **Wards**: Trinket items providing temporary vision
- **Pink wards**: Permanent vision, reveals invisible units

### Vision Control (Macro Skill)
- Place wards in river, enemy jungle to track movements
- Clear enemy wards with sweepers to deny information
- Control around major objectives (dragon, baron)
- Proper vision enables aggressive play, removes it forces safety

---

## 10. Death Timers & Respawning

### Death Mechanics
- **Elimination**: Your champion dies when HP reaches 0
- **Respawn timer**: Varies from 5 seconds (early) to 50+ seconds (late)
- **Respawn location**: Your fountain (base spawn point)
- **Gold penalty**: Death grants bounty to killer

### Strategic Implications
- Late game deaths are extremely costly (50+ second respawn)
- Prevents entire team from playing for respawn duration
- Enemy can take objectives while team is dead
- One death late game can lose game

### Death Timer Scaling
- Early game (5 min): ~5 second respawn
- Mid game (15 min): ~20 second respawn
- Late game (30+ min): ~50 second respawn
- Snowballing mechanic: Later deaths are more punishing

---

## 11. Team Fighting Fundamentals

### Teamfight Principles

**Engage & Disengage**
- Engage: Initiate the fight
- Disengage: Retreat safely from engagement
- Proper engage/disengage timing wins fights

**Positioning**
- Frontline: Durable champions (tanks, bruisers)
- Backline: Squishy champions (ADC, supports, mages)
- Maintains team formation and protection

**Target Priority**
- Primary target: Biggest threat (usually high-damage carry)
- Secondary target: Next highest priority
- Avoid: Unnecessary focus on non-threats

**Numbers Advantage**
- Winning fights through superior numbers/items
- Avoiding fights when disadvantaged numerically
- One extra champion = massive advantage (5v4 heavily favors 5)

### Team Composition Synergies
- Complementary champion kits work better
- Some combinations have powerful interactions
- Proper team comps win fights even with worse mechanics

---

## 12. Winning Conditions

### Early Game Win
- Dominating lane through better farming and trading
- Getting first kills and establishing advantages
- Denying enemy resources and scaling

### Mid Game Win
- Teamfight victories around objectives
- Converting advantages into objective control
- Securing major objectives (dragon, towers)

### Late Game Win
- Superior scaling and item advantages
- Better positioning and macro decision-making
- Baron control enabling siege

### Overall Win Condition
**Destroy enemy Nexus** = Kill all inhibitors and both nexus turrets, then damage nexus to 0 HP

## Key Takeaways

1. **Map Control Matters**: Vision and presence enable plays
2. **Economics Win Games**: Better farming = better items = stronger team
3. **Objectives > Kills**: Taking towers/dragons beats getting kills
4. **Team Coordination**: Working together beats individual skill
5. **Decision-Making**: Right play at right time wins games
6. **Experience**: Learning from mistakes improves fundamentals

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is killing minions more important than kills?**
A: Consistent minion kills provide predictable, reliable income. Champion kills are unreliable and lead to taking risky engagements.

**Q: When should I group with team vs. farm alone?**
A: When major objectives are threatened (towers, baron, dragons), group. When map is safe, farming alone maximizes income.

**Q: How do I know if we can win this teamfight?**
A: Compare team composition, item power, level advantage, health, cooldown status, and position. Winning fights requires advantage in most of these.
