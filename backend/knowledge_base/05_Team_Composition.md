# League of Legends: Team Composition & Synergies

## 1. Team Composition Fundamentals

### What is Team Composition?
Team composition (team comp) refers to the five champions selected for your team. A balanced team composition determines strategic win conditions and playstyle.

### Why Team Composition Matters
- Determines available win conditions
- Predicts game pace (early vs. late game focused)
- Influences objective priority (team fights, split push, poke)
- Creates strategic ceiling and floor for team

### Composition Balance

A balanced team composition addresses several elements:

**Damage Distribution**
- **AD/AP Split**: Mix of Attack Damage and Ability Power sources
- Prevents enemy from building single defensive stat
- Example: ADC (AD) + Mid Mage (AP) + Top Tank = balanced

**Durability**
- **Frontline**: Tanky champions absorbing damage
- **Backline**: Squishy but dealing high damage
- Balance: Team can't be all squishy

**Engage & Disengage**
- **Engage Tools**: Abilities to start fights (Leona hook, Malphite ult)
- **Disengage Tools**: Abilities to escape/prevent engagement (Lulu shield, Janna tornado)
- Balance: Needed for both proactive and reactive situations

**Range**
- **Long-range**: Safety, poke potential (ADC, mages)
- **Short-range**: Gap closers, commitment (assassins, bruisers)
- Balance: Prevents all melee or all ranged compositions

**Wave Clear**
- **AoE Abilities**: Clear minion waves quickly
- Enables wave management and siege
- Prevents being sieged under tower

**Utility & Support**
- **Shields, Heals, CC**: Non-damage contributions
- Enables carries to deal damage safely
- Amplifies team effectiveness

## 2. Basic Composition Types

### Early Game Compositions

**Characteristics**
- Strong champions at levels 1-6
- Multiple early game power spikes
- Threat of early teamfights

**Example Champions**
- Supports: Leona, Blitzcrank
- Junglers: Lee Sin, Elise
- Laners: Darius, Annie

**Win Condition**: Win early, snowball advantage

**Ideal Scenario**: Get leads by 15 minutes, press advantage

**Weakness**: Falls off if early kills don't happen

### Mid-Game Compositions

**Characteristics**
- Power spikes around 15-25 minutes
- Item-dependent (need to complete items)
- Balanced playstyle

**Example Champions**
- Versatile champions: Ahri, Malphite, Orianna
- Balanced roles across team
- Mix of dueling and teamfighting

**Win Condition**: Win through balanced gameplay, good itemization

**Ideal Scenario**: Even early game, stronger mid-game items

**Weakness**: Can be outscaled by late-game teams

### Late Game / Scaling Compositions

**Characteristics**
- Champions who improve significantly with items
- Weak early game, strong late game
- Defensive early, offensive late

**Example Champions**
- Teamfight scalers: Kayle, Kassadin, Kog'Maw
- Scaling role champions
- Weak early, exponentially stronger late

**Win Condition**: Survive early, scale into monsters late

**Ideal Scenario**: Don't lose too much early, crush late teamfights

**Weakness**: Can be eliminated before scaling occurs

## 10. Win Conditions

### Defining Win Conditions

**What is a Win Condition?**
Path your team composition naturally pursues to victory.

**Example Win Conditions**
1. **Teamfight Win**: "We win 5v5 fights around dragon/baron"
2. **Split-Push Win**: "We create 1v1 advantages through map pressure"
3. **Poke Win**: "We grind down enemy through ranged harassment, then siege"
4. **Scaling Win**: "We farm safely early, become monsters late"
5. **Early Aggression**: "We establish kills early, snowball advantage"

### Playing to Win Condition

**Teamfight Composition**
- Group for objectives
- Avoid split-pushing
- Setup coordinated fights

**Split-Push Composition**
- Avoid 5v5 grouping
- Create 1v1 advantages
- Pressure multiple lanes

**Scaling Composition**
- Play safe early
- Farm efficiently
- Avoid unnecessary fights early

### Adapting When Losing

If falling behind with specific win condition:
- Pivot to different strategy if possible
- Extend game to reach scaling point
- Attempt high-risk plays to regain momentum
- Acknowledge if win condition failed

## 11. Common Composition Mistakes

### Mistake 1: No Clear Win Condition
- **Problem**: Comp has no clear path to victory
- **Example**: Scaling comp with early game champion
- **Fix**: Ensure comp has identifiable win condition

### Mistake 2: No Frontline
- **Problem**: Team gets run down, dies instantly
- **Example**: All squish champions, no tank
- **Fix**: Pick at least one durable champion

### Mistake 3: No Damage
- **Problem**: Can't kill enemies or take objectives
- **Example**: All utility, no damage sources
- **Fix**: Have consistent damage source

### Mistake 4: Missing Win Condition Play
- **Problem**: Comp has win condition but team plays wrong strategy
- **Example**: Split-push comp but 5 grouping constantly
- **Fix**: Align playstyle with composition

### Mistake 5: No Adaptation to Enemy Comp
- **Problem**: Pick same comp regardless of opponent matchup
- **Example**: Scaling comp into early game aggression
- **Fix**: Scout opponent, adapt picks accordingly

## Common Questions

**Q: Can any 5 champions win together?**
A: Technically yes, but some combinations are much harder to execute.

**Q: How important is team comp?**
A: Very, but not deterministic. Better team can win with worse comp.

**Q: Should I always pick the same role?**
A: Learning multiple roles helps understand comp requirements.

**Q: Can I win with only one win condition?**
A: Yes, but adaptability is valuable. Having secondary plan is better.

**Q: How do I know if enemy comp is weak?**
A: Missing essential elements (tank, damage, utility) or has exploitable weaknesses.
