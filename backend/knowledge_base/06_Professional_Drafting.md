# League of Legends: Professional Drafting Strategy

## 1. Drafting Overview

### What is Drafting?
Drafting (pick/ban phase) is the strategic process where teams select champions and ban opposing champions before the game begins. Strategic decisions made here directly influence game outcome.

### Why Drafting Matters
- Determines available strategies for both teams
- Creates win conditions and matchups
- Can win or lose at champion select
- Professional teams spend hours preparing draft strategies

### Drafting Statistics
- Professional teams: 40-50% of win prediction comes from draft
- Skilled teams can convert bad drafts to wins
- Poor drafts are nearly unwinnable against good opponents
- Some teams are known for "winning draft phase"

## 2. Draft Phase Structure (Professional)

### Pick/Ban Order (10 Ban System)

**Complete Order**
```
Bans:     B1 → R1 → B2 → R2 → B3 → R3
Picks:    B1 → R1 → R2 → B2 → B3 → R3 → R4 → B4 → B5 → R5
```

**Explanation**
- B = Blue team, R = Red team
- Each number = draft rotation
- Asymmetry balances sides (Blue first pick, Red next two picks)

### Ban Phase (First 6 Bans)

**Blue Team Ban Phase**
- Ban 1: First team ban (most impactful)
- Ban 2: React to red's first picks
- Ban 3: Target priority picks

**Red Team Ban Phase**
- Ban 1: React to blue's priority
- Ban 2: Attack blue's strategy
- Ban 3: Final targeted ban

**Strategic Considerations**
- First bans often target OP champions in meta
- Later bans target specific team strengths
- Can ban "comfort picks" of opposing players
- Can prevent enemy comp strategies

### Pick Phase (First 3 Picks - Phase 1)

**Blue Team Pick 1 (B1)**
- Usually strongest meta pick available
- Secures top tier champion
- Sets team direction
- Telegraphs team strategy somewhat

**Red Team Pick 1 & 2 (R1, R2)**
- Pick flexible champions (work multiple positions)
- Avoid committing to strategy too early
- Often pick Jungle/Support (flexible, hard to counter)
- Keep solo lanes open for later counter-picks

**Blue Team Pick 2 & 3 (B2, B3)**
- React to red's 2 picks
- Attempt counter-picks if beneficial
- Fill remaining gaps in composition
- Balance team strength

### Pick Phase (Phase 2 - Bans 4-5)

**Red Team Ban 4 & Blue Team Ban 4**
- Target specific matchups
- Prevent counters to existing picks
- Ban OP remaining picks

**Blue Team Ban 5 & Red Team Ban 5**
- Final targeted bans
- Eliminate most threatening remaining options
- Set up final pick phase

### Pick Phase (Final 2 Picks - Phase 2)

**Red Team Pick 4 (R4)**
- Often final flex pick or counter-pick
- Can finalize strategy
- Last red side pick (advantage for counter-picking)

**Blue Team Pick 4 (B4)**
- React to red's final flex
- Finalize team composition
- Secure hard counter if available

**Red Team Pick 5 & Blue Team Pick 5 (R5, B5)**
- Final picks, usually role-specific
- Often last role to complete (support/mid typically)
- Final compositional balance

## 3. Banning Strategies

### Ban Category 1: OP Champions

**Definition**: Champions considered overpowered in current meta

**Characteristics**
- High win rate across ranks
- Popular pick among all roles/regions
- Difficult to execute against
- Appear in majority of professional picks

**Example OP Bans**
- Zeri (if overpowered): Mid elo stomper, pro priority
- Akali (if overpowered): Highest mechanical champion
- Kayn (when strong): Versatile, scaling threat

**Blue Side Consideration**
- Can leave up OP champions if comfortable
- Alternatively, remove strongest options
- Forces opponents to play non-optimal picks

### Ban Category 2: Team-Specific Threats

**Definition**: Strong champions of opposing team or players

**Identifying Threats**
- Scout opponent team champion pools
- Ban champion players excel at
- Research player statistics by champion
- Prevent comfort picks

**Example Specific Bans**
- "Opposing Top laner plays Camille exceptionally"
  - Ban Camille to force different pick
- "Enemy mid main is Ahri specialist"
  - Ban Ahri removes their comfort
- "Opposing ADC is exceptional on Kalista"
  - Ban Kalista prevents momentum

**Strategic Value**
- Forces players outside comfort zone
- Reduces individual skill differential
- Disrupts team synergies reliant on specific champion

### Ban Category 3: Compositional Counters

**Definition**: Banning champions that counter your planned composition

**Example Scenarios**
- "We're picking teamfight comp"
  - Ban: Engage prevention champions (Tahm Kench, Lulu)
- "We're picking poke comp"
  - Ban: Gap closers that counter poke (Leona, Alistar)
- "We're picking split-push comp"
  - Ban: Champions that counter split-push (global teleports)

**Strategic Thinking**
- Identify threats to your win condition
- Remove champions preventing execution
- Enables smoother team coordination

### Ban Category 4: Flex Picks Prevention

**Definition**: Banning flexible champions that can play multiple roles

**Flexible Champions to Ban**
- Lulu (top/mid/support)
- Twisted Fate (mid/support)
- Nautilus (support/top/mid)
- Elise (jungle/mid)

**Why Ban Flex Picks**
- Reduces opponent flexibility
- Forces clearer picks/counter-picking
- Limits strategic options
- Creates exploitable patterns

---

## 4. Picking Strategies

### Pick Strategy 1: Secure Strong Meta Picks

**Definition**: Taking overpowered champions before opponent can

**Blue Side (B1) Advantage**
- First pick secures strongest meta pick
- Usually highest priority
- Sets tone for teamfighting

**Example B1 Picks**
- Tier 1 strongest champion (whatever patch dictates)
- Usually contested if available

**Red Side Adaptation**
- Often accept B1 take strongest, counter in later picks
- Use R1/R2 to secure own strong picks
- Flex picks less committed early

### Pick Strategy 2: Blind Picking Safe Champions

**Definition**: Picking champions with few bad matchups

**Characteristics of Safe Picks**
- Perform adequately against most opponents
- Scaling adequate (won't lose matchup)
- Flexible in different situations
- Examples: Ahri, Orianna, Annie (mid lane)

**When to Blind Pick**
- Early phase when opponent picks unknown
- When champion has no hard counters
- Setting up team foundation without telegraphing

**Risk Assessment**
- Safe from hard counters but may not win lane
- Enables reactive picks later
- Prevents predictable pattern

### Pick Strategy 3: Counter-Picking

**Definition**: Picking champion that beats specific opponent pick

**Counter-Pick Timing**
- Usually later in draft (B2, B3, R3, R4 onwards)
- After opponent reveals their picks
- Requires champion knowledge (matchup expertise)

**Example Counter Scenarios**
- Opponent picks Melee Assassin
  - Counter: Ranged, slippery, defensive options
- Opponent picks Aggressive Support
  - Counter: Punishing supports, high damage

**Risk/Reward**
- Reward: Win lane decisively through matchup
- Risk: Locks into specific playstyle, less flexibility

### Pick Strategy 4: Setting Up Win Condition

**Definition**: Picking champions that enable planned win condition

**Example 1: Teamfight Composition**
- B1: Malphite (strong engage tool)
- R1/R2: Tank and another teamfighter
- Gradually stack teamfight champions

**Example 2: Split-Push Composition**
- B1: Strong meta split-pusher
- R1/R2: Support and scaling teammates
- Build comp enabling split-push strategy

**Example 3: Early Aggression**
- B1: Early game dominator
- R1/R2: Gank enablers, early power spikes
- Build for early game victory

## 5. Draft Phase By Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: B1-B3 (First Picks)

**Blue Team Responsibility (B1)**
- Secure strongest available champion
- Telegraphs team direction somewhat
- Establishes blue's priority pick
- Most important first pick choice

**Red Team Responsibility (R1, R2)**
- Reacting to B1 selection
- Securing own strong picks (often flex)
- NOT committing to strategy yet (flexibility maintained)
- Usually: Jungle + one flex pick

**Blue Team Response (B2, B3)**
- React to Red's direction
- Attempt soft counters if beneficial
- Balance team composition
- Save one lane for counter-picking

**Strategic Principles Phase 1**
- Red Team generally picks flex picks (Jungle/Support typically)
- Blue Team can scout direction
- Solo lanes usually saved for counter-picks
- Mid-phase uncertainty is intentional

### Phase 2: R4-B5 (Final Picks)

**Red Team (R4)**
- Final flex pick or counter-pick opportunity
- Can see full blue comp (nearly complete)
- Often final role to complete
- Significant advantage for counter-picking

**Blue Team Ban (B4)**
- Block most threatening remaining picks
- Final targeted bans
- Remove red's counter-pick options

**Blue Team Final (B5)**
- Last pick, usually support/mid
- Final compositional balance
- Role assignment completion
- Often most predictable role

**Blue Team Ban (B5)**
- Final ban if needed
- Less critical than earlier bans

**Strategic Principles Phase 2**
- Red gets last pick advantage (better counter-pick)
- Blue must anticipate and block threats proactively
- Draft flexibility earlier enables last-pick optimization

## 6. Blue vs. Red Side Strategies

### Blue Side Advantages
- **First Pick**: Secures strongest champion
- **Pick Order**: Sets initial direction
- **Predictability**: First move telegraphs some intent

**Blue Side Strategy**
- Secure OP pick immediately
- Establish team direction clearly
- Leave OP picks for opponent, confident own comp better
- Predictable but potentially superior composition

### Red Side Advantages
- **Reaction Time**: Fully informed B1
- **Next Two Picks**: Flexible choices after B1 seen
- **Last Pick**: R4 last pick advantage for counter-picking
- **Adaptability**: More reactive, flexible approach

**Red Side Strategy**
- Flex pick (Jungle/Support) after seeing B1
- Keep options open longer
- Leverage last pick advantage
- Capitalize on information advantage

### Draft Asymmetry Impact
- Blue side: Proactive, predictable, potentially stronger
- Red side: Reactive, flexible, leverage information
- Counterbalances first-pick advantage
- Creates interesting strategic tension

---

## 7. Advanced Draft Concepts

### Information Advantage

**What is Information Advantage**
- Red team knows B1-B3 picks before R1 decision
- Red leverages full information for flexible picks
- Creates information asymmetry

**Exploiting Information**
- Red picks flexible champion that works into blue comp
- Blue bans based on assumptions about red's strategy
- Red counters blue's predictions with flexible pick

**Blue Counter-Strategy**
- Blue makes B1 so strong it doesn't matter
- Blue secures multiple options through picks
- Blue bans preemptively to limit red flexibility

### Flex Picks & Misdirection

**Flex Picking**
- Champions playable in multiple positions
- Red uses B1 knowledge to pick flexible champion
- Prevents blue from identifying red's strategy
- Increases red's adaptation possibilities

**Misdirection Tactics**
- Pick ambiguous champion that works two roles
- Force opponent to guess final role allocation
- Counter-pick possibilities against all potential lanes
- Example: Lulu picked could go top/mid/support

**Blue Counter-Misdirection**
- Ask "who is this champion for?"
- Plan bans assuming various placements
- Avoid overcomitting to single counter
- Have backup plans for ambiguous picks

### Contextual Knowledge

**Pre-Game Preparation**
- Scout opponent team
- Research player champion pools
- Identify comfort picks of each player
- Study recent team games for patterns

**In-Game Adjustment**
- Adapt bans based on opponent pattern
- Exploit known player preferences
- Prevent signature strategies
- Force unconventional picks

**Information Sources**
- Professional player statistics
- Prior scrimmage results
- Public ranked statistics (U.GG, OP.GG)
- Player champion mastery data

---

## 8. Special Draft Tactics

### Power Move 1: Taking Comfort Pick Early

**Strategy**
- Identify opposing player's comfort pick
- Take it from opponent instead of banning
- Denies opponent, boosts own team's pick

**Example**
- "Opposing ADC specializes in Kai'Sa"
- Blue takes Kai'Sa instead of banning
- Forces ADC to different champion
- Blue confident in Kai'Sa

**Risk/Reward**
- Gain: Take strong pick, deny opponent
- Risk: Commit to champion potentially not ideal

### Power Move 2: Unconventional Picks

**Strategy**
- Pick less common champion with team synergy
- Opponent unprepared for specific synergy
- Off-meta pick can catch teams unaware

**Example**
- Team coordinates off-meta support
- Opponent didn't expect it
- Synergy advantage overwhelming

**Risk/Reward**
- Gain: Surprise factor, unique synergy
- Risk: Unrefined pick, unclear execution

### Power Move 3: Banning Comfort Picks of Star Player

**Strategy**
- Opponent has standout player
- Ban their comfort champions
- Force them into unfamiliar territory
- Reduce skill differential

**Example**
- Enemy top laner excels at three champions
- Ban all three
- Force fourth-best champion
- Neutralize skill advantage

## 9. Draft Mistakes & Corrections

### Mistake 1: Drafting Without Win Condition
- **Problem**: Picks don't align on strategy
- **Example**: Mix of split-push and teamfight champs
- **Fix**: Identify win condition first, pick toward it

### Mistake 2: Taking Too Many All-Ins
- **Problem**: Entire comp requires to win fights
- **Example**: All engage, no disengage options
- **Fix**: Balance engage/disengage tools

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Opponent Threats
- **Problem**: Don't ban key opponent cards
- **Example**: Enemy strong at one strategy, don't block it
- **Fix**: Scout and ban key threats

### Mistake 4: Over-Committing Early
- **Problem**: Lock in specific strategy too early
- **Example**: All three first picks telegraph direction
- **Fix**: Flex second red picks, save counter-picks

### Mistake 5: Leaving OP Champions Up
- **Problem**: Don't ban top-tier meta champions
- **Example**: S-tier champion available, don't take/ban
- **Fix**: Prioritize meta's strongest champions

## 10. Draft Psychology

### Opponent Mind Games

**Red's Perspective**
- Blue picked strong direction
- Red needs to find synergistic flex picks
- Red can counter-pick with information

**Blue's Perspective**
- Red's first picks ambiguous
- Blue must decide what red is doing
- Blue bans preemptively or adapts

### Psychological Warfare
- Convincing opponent of false strategy through picks
- Drafting threatening comp to provoke bans
- Forcing emotional responses through picks

### Communication in Draft

**Internal Team Communication**
- Clear on win condition before drafting
- Communicate picks meaning to teammates
- Avoid confusion about strategy

**External Communication**
- Some professional teams communicate picks subtly
- Body language and reaction times
- Reading opponent reactions to infer thinking

## 11. Role-Specific Draft Recommendations

### Top Lane Priority

**Drafting Considerations**
- Likely picked early if strong meta
- Usually saved for counter-picking
- Can be flex pick for some champions

**Blue Side**: Consider B1 top if extremely OP

**Red Side**: Often pick top as R3 counter-pick

### Jungle Priority

**Drafting Considerations**
- Often picked R1 (flexible, difficult to counter)
- Enables team strategy (ganking, scaling)
- Player-dependent champion pool

**Blue Side**: Secure strong jungle B1 if priority

**Red Side**: Flex jungle R1 keeping options open

### Mid Lane Priority

**Drafting Considerations**
- Usually counter-picked
- Saved for late picks (B3, R3)
- Player-dependent mains/pools

**Blue Side**: Save for counter-pick B3

**Red Side**: Save for counter-pick R3

### ADC Priority

**Drafting Considerations**
- Determined by meta picks
- Scaling importance varies
- Team dependent strategy

**Blue Side**: Priority if meta ADC extremely OP

**Red Side**: Flexibly pick if strong scaling

### Support Priority

**Drafting Considerations**
- Often picked early (flex pick)
- Enables bot lane strategy
- Macro impact (vision, roaming)

**Blue Side**: Consider B2/B3 if strong support meta

**Red Side**: Often R1/R2 for flexibility

## 12. Professional Teams' Draft Styles

### Proactive Teams
- Take aggressive B1 picks
- Secure strong meta champions
- Establish clear win conditions
- Confident in ability to execute strategy

**Example**: Team confident in teamfighting ability picks engage comp

### Reactive Teams
- Save flex picks for reaction
- Use red side advantage efficiently
- Counter-pick focused strategy
- Exploit opponent predictability

**Example**: Team picks Jungle R1, adapts to opponent entirely

### Balanced Teams
- Proactive first phase
- Reactive second phase
- Flexible mid-phase adjustments
- Adaptive to opponent

## 13. Patch Impact on Drafting

### Meta Definition
- Patch changes champion balance
- Creates new OP champions
- Nerfs previous priority picks
- Shifts optimal strategies

### Adaptation Process
- First 1-2 weeks: Teams learn new meta
- Weeks 2-4: Meta solidifies
- Tournament point: Everyone knows optimal picks
- Mid-tournament: Counter-strategies emerge

### Drafting at Tournaments
- All teams know meta well
- Games predetermined somewhat by meta
- Adaptation/counter-strategies matter
- Last-minute patches cause chaos
